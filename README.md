# .TXT-Compressor-Decompressor
Implemented Word-based lossless compression algorithm for text files by exploiting the redundancies in the text, compressing  it to represent the input file in less space and simulating channel transmission over UDP protocol. After complete reception, de-compressing it to retrieve the original text file.
